## Todo Idea

- [ ] Auto stop feeding if time is larger than 1h ? (set to average feedings)
- [ ] Group History by date (with day count)
- [ ] Allow edit date and time
- [ ] Add Bottle feeding (in ML)
- [ ] Add setup (Name, Birth , ...)
- [ ] Add nice Chart like [....||...|...||||]
- [ ] Both Sides?
- [ ] Add time between feeding in history
